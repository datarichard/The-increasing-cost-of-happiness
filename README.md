# Abstract

A fundamental question for society is how much happiness does a dollar
buy? The accepted view among economists and psychologists is that income
has diminishing marginal returns on happiness: money and happiness
increase together up to a point after which there is relatively little
further gain. In this paper we estimate the relationship between income
and subjective wellbeing over a 19-year period focusing on where the
greatest change in the marginal return on income occurs and whether this
change point has shifted over time. We formally test for the presence of
a change point as well temporal changes in the relationship between
income and affective wellbeing (happiness), and income and cognitive
wellbeing (life satisfaction), using household economic data from
Australia between 2001-2019. The results indicate that the change point
between affective wellbeing and income has increased over those 19 years
faster than inflation (i.e., cost of living). This suggests that
inequalities in income may be driving increasing *inequities* in
happiness between the rich and the poor, with implications for health
and recent government policy-goals to monitor and improve wellbeing.
